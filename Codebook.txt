This dataset contains means of means and standard deviations from multiple measures by subject("ID") and activities measured("activity")

Variables and descriptions
============================
ID: Subject ID
activity: Activity measured. Each participant should have six activities measured. They are: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS

All other variables are means of components of measures from accelerometer and gyroscope. The naming rule follows:
t: Denotes time
f: Denotes frequency domain signals
Acc: Indicates measures from accelerometer
Gyro: Indicates measures from gyroscope
X/Y/Y:  Indicates the axis measured
Jerk: Denotes Jerk signals
Mag: Denotes magnitude of signals
angle: Denotes angle between two vector

Examples of variable naming rule
===================================
1. "tBodyAcc.mean.X": mean for the measure of time on body accelerometer on x axis
2. "fBodyGyro.std.Y": means for the standard deviations of measures of frequency on body gyroscope on y axis
